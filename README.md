ABSTRACT: For this project I worked on finishing a budget tracker app. The app can log a user's budget and save it. It will also be able to work offline on heroku and not just on local in future updates.

ii: USAGE
-Layout is as it appears. The website takes in a name and asks for an amount to deposit or subtract, that amount is then rendered to the chart and can be saved and reloaded for future reference. Still currently trying to get ServiceWorker to work. More updates coming soon.
